# MedicineNotebook

this application will help you manage your own and your family members’ medicine-taking time. It allows you to make a “medicine schedule” and gives you an option to set up alarms to remind you when the time for taking medicines comes.
Beside that, you can also note down some information of the medicines and the prescriptions, so that you can refer to them without carrying the real ones anywhere you go.
